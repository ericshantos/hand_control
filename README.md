## Description

The **Hand Control** project is an application that allows controlling the system volume and screen brightness using hand gestures captured by a camera. It uses the **MediaPipe** library for hand tracking and calculates the distance between fingers to adjust system properties.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language of the project.
- **OpenCV**: Image capture and processing.
- **MediaPipe**: Hand detection and tracking.
- **Pycaw**: System volume control (Windows only).
- **screen_brightness_control**: Screen brightness adjustment.

## Features

- Real-time hand detection.
- Calculation of the distance between thumb and index finger.
- System volume adjustment when the left hand is detected.
- Screen brightness adjustment when the right hand is detected.
- Display of processed hands on the screen.
